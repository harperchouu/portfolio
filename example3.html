    <article><br>
      <p>In October 2024, a secret filming incident in an all-gender restroom at National Chengchi University’s Da-Yong Building sparked heated public discourse on the issue of gender-inclusive facilities. In February 2025, another case at National Taiwan University, where a foreign student was secretly filmed in a similar restroom, once again raised concerns about the safety and privacy of such spaces. </p>
      <p>While gender-inclusive restrooms were established with good intentions, the lack of comprehensive planning and uniform standards have not only fueled public misunderstanding about such spaces, but also thwarted their original aim. </p>
      
      
      <h2>Security Concerns Rise Over Gender-Inclusive Restrooms</h2><br>
      <p>Traditional restrooms are typically divided by male and female genders, which fail to meet the needs of some groups. For example, non-binary and transgender individuals may experience emotional stress or even face judgmental stares under this conventional framework. The establishment of gender-inclusive restrooms helps break down gender-based barriers with the intent to offer every individual the ability to use a restroom more comfortably.</p>
      <p>“I don’t look like a typical woman, so I’m often mistaken for male when I enter female restrooms. Sometimes, I even need to mentally prepare myself (when entering the restroom),” said Lin Jie-Yu, a non-binary individual. She also mentioned that a well-designed gender-inclusive restroom can offer a better user experience than traditional restrooms.</p>
      <p>Many parents often face a similar dilemma—whether to enter the male or female restroom—when going out with their children. Liu is a mother with two kids. She shared that although no one questions her when she brings her three-year-old son into the women’s restroom, all-gender restrooms are still much more convenient.</p>
      <p>“One, there’s usually no line for gender-inclusive restrooms; and two, the space is larger,” she said. For parents like Liu who have more than one child, gender-inclusive restrooms allow the whole family to enter together, making trips to the restroom much more efficient.</p>
      
      
      <h2>Difficulties in establishing gender-inclusive restrooms</h2><br>
      <p>Data from Taiwan’s Ministry of Environment as of 2024 shows that there are 623 gender-inclusive restrooms nationwide. The majority of these are located on university campuses, including National Taiwan University, National Chengchi University, National Chung Hsing University, National Cheng Kung University, and Fu Jen Catholic University. The 2020 report “Survey and Evaluation of Gender-Inclusive and Safe Spaces on University Campuses” by Professor Pi Heng-da of National Taiwan University’s Graduate Institute of Building and Planning was also encouraging; it found that 117 out of 157 universities and colleges in Taiwan had installed at least one all-gender restroom. However, when excluding facilities that were only labeled as such without performing any renovation or construction to make the space gender-inclusive, the number drops to just 58 schools, less than 40 percent.</p>
      <p>The government is currently seeking to promote the construction of such new facilities. However, Wu Chih-kuang, a professor of law at Fu Jen Catholic University, believes that widespread implementation faces ongoing challenges. He noted that public institutions, such as schools, have more flexibility in allocating space. In contrast, private institutions often face cost concerns, and retrofitting older buildings to accommodate new facilities is especially difficult.</p>

      <p>“To address this, a possible approach is to apply the requirement only to new constructions,” Wu suggests. “That way, cost and space considerations can be incorporated during the design stage.”</p>
     
      
      <h2>Accessible Restrooms Re-labeled “Gender-Inclusive”<br>
        Users Fear Being Stigmatized
        </h2><br>
      
      <p>According to the project “A Deep Dive into Gender-Inclusive Restrooms in High Schools,” jointly launched by the Taiwan Tongzhi Hotline Association, Taiwan Gender Equity Education Association, Taiwan Alliance to Promote Civil Partnership Rights, and a former Taipei City youth representative, a significant gap exists between signage and actual facility inclusiveness. </p>

      <p>To address the lack of effectiveness in reporting systems, the Taipei City Government has begun to strengthen anti-scalping measures through both policy and budgetary efforts. In response to the chaotic ticketing market surrounding Jay Chou’s concert, the city’s Department of Cultural Affairs allocated NT$5 million (USD 156,000) toward the government’s additional support program “Dispute Resolution for Arts and Cultural Consumption and the Prevention of Ticket Scalping” to curb high-priced resales by scalpers, and encourage ticketing platforms to adopt an identity verification system or lottery-based system.</p>
      <p>Taiwan has gradually begun implementing an identity verification system and a lottery-based system in order to ease the outrageous ticket scalping problem. Research by Chen and his team has found that concerts without an identity verification system see over a hundred reports of scalping activity. In contrast, concerts that adopt identity verification have fewer than ten reported cases, demonstrating that the system can effectively prevent scalpers.</p>
      <p>The survey, which examined 30 gender-inclusive restrooms across 11 senior high schools in Taipei, revealed that 86.7% were simply accessible restrooms that had been relabeled with gender-inclusive signage. Only 13.3% (four restrooms) met the criteria for a “centralized” gender-inclusive restroom, which includes a squat toilet, a seated toilet, and a urinal all within the same space to accommodate diverse user needs.</p>

      <p>Beyond schools, many private sector buildings also label existing accessible restrooms as gender-inclusive facilities due to concerns over cost, space efficiency, and other practical limitations. “In the private sector, setting up gender-inclusive restrooms often comes down to space efficiency—how effectively a space is utilized,” explained survey respondent Wu, “Naturally, private entities tend to have reservations about such changes.”</p>
      <p>However, such an approach may discourage people from using these facilities. “If I go somewhere with a men’s restroom, a women’s restroom, and a so-called gender-inclusive one that looks like a converted accessible restroom, I’ll choose the women’s restroom,” said respondent Lin. Respondent Gong Wan, a biologically female individual who identifies more with the male gender, shared a similar experience, “Walking into a gender-inclusive restroom sometimes feels like my identity needs to be treated as something exceptional.”</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <h2>Lack of Mandatory Standards Raises Privacy and Safety Concerns in Restroom Design<br>
      
        </h2><br>
      <p>The current design of gender-inclusive restrooms remains inconsistent due to the lack of mandatory regulations. As a result, some facilities fail to adequately address concerns over privacy and safety during the planning phases. Wu explained that traditional men’s and women’s restrooms, as well as accessible and parenting restrooms, are subject to specific provisions, including the number of restroom fixtures, under Taiwan’s Building Act. Failure to comply can result in penalties.</p>
      <p>In contrast, gender-inclusive restrooms are still in a preliminary phase and are not yet governed by detailed legal standards. The only general guideline is that each fixture must be enclosed in a separate space; however there are no related rules regarding the types or number of fixtures, or even the clearance between partitions and the floor.</p>
      <p>The clearance between partitions and the floor remains a major concern in gender-inclusive restrooms. To prevent privacy issues such as secret filming, regulations on stall design are essential. After using the gender-inclusive restroom at National Chengchi University, a student named Xiaopang said the security measures were insufficient. “Ever since the secret filming incident happened there, I’ve refused to use that restroom again,” Xiaopang added.</p>
      <p>When it comes to whether gender-inclusive restrooms should be subject to standardized construction regulations, Wu said there is still room for discussion. “It’s possible to clearly define [requirements] in relevant regulations, including the design of the restroom,” he noted.</p>
      <p>Another student, Pi, offered a different perspective. He cautioned against imposing standardized rules, arguing that gender cultures, user habits, and environments vary widely across locations. “No single design can achieve the perfect outcome in every aspect. Designers must make informed decisions,” he emphasized.</p>
      <p>National Chengchi University’s Gender Equity Education Committee (hereafter referred to as NCCU GEC) echoed this view, pointing out that each building has its own structural limitations, making it difficult to fully follow the Campus Gender-Inclusive Restroom and Dormitory Design Guidelines. However, in light of recent secret filming incidents, concerns about safety in gender-inclusive spaces have drawn significant attention nationwide. In response, the committee announced that it plans to revise its design guidelines with the aim of improving both inclusivity and safety in restroom facilities.</p>
      
      <h2>Promoting Gender-Inclusive Values Through Equality Education<br> </h2><br>
      <p>With the growing emphasis on gender equality education, discussions around the design and implementation of gender-inclusive restrooms continue to evolve. The NCCU GEC noted that increased exposure to gender equality education in high school has already led to greater acceptance of gender-inclusive restrooms among students.</p>
      <p>Looking ahead, the Committee has emphasized the importance of enhancing safety measures and addressing the public’s negative perceptions of these restrooms. As a relatively new concept, gender-inclusive restrooms are often subject to misunderstandings and exaggerated fear. The Committee has noted that concerns such as secret filming are not exclusive to gender-inclusive facilities—traditional restrooms face similar, or even greater challenges in preventing such violations.</p>
      <p>To promote a more accurate understanding of all-gender restrooms, Yang Yun-Chen, a student representative on the Ministry of Education’s Gender Equality Education Committee, suggested incorporating the establishment of gender-inclusive restrooms into school evaluations. However, she noted that the actual implementation and related guidelines fall under the control of universities themselves. It is more feasible to include such requirements in evaluation criteria for schools at the high school level and below, which are under the government’s purview.</p>
      <p>In parallel, open and transparent dialogue among multiple stakeholders can help clarify public misconceptions about gender-inclusive restrooms. Kao Chih-Han, Deputy Secretary-General of the Taiwan Gender Equity Education Association, cited Makung Elementary School in Magong City, Penghu County, as an example. When the school renovated its restroom facilities, it built on the concept of “designed to feel like home, rather than dividing by biological sex.” Instead of informing the community of the gender-inclusive restrooms only after construction was completed, the school engaged community members from the outset. Students, parents, and teachers were all involved in the design process, from the exterior appearance to the interior layout, transforming the restrooms into a collaborative project.</p>
      <p>Kao emphasized that participants in the Makung Elementary School project were all encouraged to reflect on what restrooms should represent. Ultimately, their shared decisions to incorporate elements of universal design, such as accessible features, storage space, and braille signage into gender-inclusive restrooms, along with replacing traditional gendered signage with neutral symbols like toilet icons, helped the public to break away from stereotypes, allowing the space to fulfill its original purpose: meeting the needs of all users.</p>
      <p>Despite some remaining practical concerns surrounding all-gender restrooms and remaining unfamiliarity with such facilities among the general public, open dialogue and comprehensive guidelines can help attain a balance between inclusivity and safety in such restroom spaces.</p>
