    <article><br>
      <p>When tickets for Jay Chou’s long-awaited Taiwan concert went on sale, the online ticketing platform crashed almost instantly, leaving thousands of fans staring helplessly at a loading screen. Tickets sold out within just a few minutes—yet almost as quickly, they began surfacing in private resale groups. Some of these tickets were priced as high as NT$300,000 (approximately US$9,200), according to a report by United Daily News (UDN). </p>
      <p>This incident triggered widespread debate over ticket scalping and fairness in Taiwan’s concert market. Despite soaring prices, many fans remain willing to pay scalpers extreme amounts just to see their idols, highlighting both a growing imbalance between supply and demand in Taiwan’s ticketing ecosystem, as well as fans’ hunger for live performances.</p>
      
      
      <h2>Widening Gap Between Concert Ticket Supply and Demand Fuels Scalping</h2><br>
      <p>Kuan-Tsung Chiu, the CEO of ticketing platform TixCraft, said the rise in scalping is a direct result of market dynamics. “Scalpers profit from the gap between face value and what consumers are willing to pay,” he explained. “If tickets are gone in seconds and resale prices soar, that’s a sign the original pricing was too low.” Chiu believes that the core problem isn’t scalping itself, but the supply-demand mismatch. He notes an event with just 10,000 seats that had to fend off millions of ticket scalping bots as a recent example of the imbalance.</p>
      <p>Chiu also points to the limited number of concert dates and flawed allocation of public event spaces as contributing factors in the affordability and availability of tickets. He explains that while ticketing companies often recommend that organizers add more shows, government assessments always result in only one or two additional performances. Moreover, major acts are sometimes assigned to smaller venues, while larger spaces remain unused. Tai-Ying Li, Section Chief of Taipei’s Department of Cultural Affairs, acknowledged that the government prioritizes local performers over international performers; ticket sales are just one of several criteria in their consideration. However, scheduling popular artists to perform in relatively small venues exacerbates the ticket shortage, making ticket scalping inevitable.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      <h2>Current Anti-Scalping Regulations Are Ineffective</h2><br>
      <p>To better understand public opinion on scalped tickets, a survey conducted by the Author team between March 28 and April 2 gathered 548 valid responses across Facebook, Dcard, and Instagram. While over half of respondents claimed they had never purchased scalped tickets, nearly half said they would consider doing so if they could afford it.</p>

      style="max-width:70%; height:auto; display:block; margin:20px auto;">
      <p>One of the respondents, Yang, said he didn’t resent scalpers. “If I’m fine with the price and they can provide the seat I want, it’s a fair deal”. User Cheng, a K-pop fan, agreed with that opinion, adding that instead of wasting hours refreshing the ticketing website, he would rather pay an acceptable price to the scalpers: “I don’t support scalping, but if that’s the only way to see my idol, I will go for it.” </p>
      <img src="https://github.com/harperchouu/portfolio/blob/main/%E6%98%AF%20(47).png?raw=true" alt="Survey Image" 
      style="max-width:70%; height:auto; display:block; margin:20px auto;">
      <p>As an example, Cheng says, “I saw a deal on the Chinese app WeChat. The seller was Taiwanese, and he offered a very affordable price, so I bought it.” Another fan, Xiao Lin, mentioned that it's become harder to purchase tickets since the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions eased and concert demand surged. Scalping is filling an unmet market need, and is thus unlikely to abate on its own. </p>
      <p>Although the government has amended legislation to curb ticket scalping, scalpers will continue to thrive as long as strong market demand exists. According to Mr. N (a pseudonym), a well-known scalper in Northeast Asia, local scalpers in Taiwan have declined since the amendments to the Creative Industries Development Act (hereafter referred to as the “CIDA”). However, he noted that the legislative changes have also opened the door for more overseas scalpers to fill the gap. “For example, in Jay Chou’s concert, most of the tickets were controlled by scalpers from China and Hong Kong. Due to their similarities in language and close geographic location, they can enter the market very fast,” said Mr. N.</p>

      <h2>Reporting Scalpers Remains Difficult<br>  
        Identity Verification and Lotteries Offer Little Defense</h2><br>
      <p>Revisions made to CIDA in 2023 explicitly outlaw ticket scalping practices, including reselling tickets at inflated prices and using bots or any ticket scalping computing technologies. In parallel, Taipei’s Department of Cultural Affairs established an online platform for the general public to report scalpers or illegal behaviors. However, successfully reporting scalpers remains difficult. Reporters are required to submit detailed information, such as the source of the ticket, seat numbers, and specific evidence. In most cases, scalpers only reveal these details after the transaction is completed, making it nearly impossible to report scalpers without engaging in the actual purchase. </p>
      <p>According to Taipei City Councilor You-Cheng Chen, as of Nov. 8, 2024 (post-CIDA revisions), the Taipei government had received 1,805 complaints. However, only 784 were validated, and just 24—a mere 3%—resulted in fines. The data suggest that the existing reporting platform has limited effectiveness in curbing scalping. As a result, the public is often left with no choice but to compete with scalpers for tickets at every concert. “Most reporters are dismissed because the necessary information is missing; without the information, we can’t prompt an investigation," said Li, frustrated.</p>
      <p>Li further explained that most ticket scalping transactions now take place on social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram, making it difficult to verify the true identity of the seller. “The most challenging part is locating the scalper’s address and household registration records,” she added. Another K-pop fan, Tsai, pointed out the misalignment in motivations, “People who want to buy scalped tickets won’t report scalpers, and people who want to report scalpers will never buy from them.” </p>
      <p>To address the lack of effectiveness in reporting systems, the Taipei City Government has begun to strengthen anti-scalping measures through both policy and budgetary efforts. In response to the chaotic ticketing market surrounding Jay Chou’s concert, the city’s Department of Cultural Affairs allocated NT$5 million (USD 156,000) toward the government’s additional support program “Dispute Resolution for Arts and Cultural Consumption and the Prevention of Ticket Scalping” to curb high-priced resales by scalpers, and encourage ticketing platforms to adopt an identity verification system<sup>[1]</sup> or lottery-based system<sup>[2]</sup>.</p>
      <p>Taiwan has gradually begun implementing an identity verification system and a lottery-based system in order to ease the outrageous ticket scalping problem. Research by Chen and his team has found that concerts without an identity verification system see over a hundred reports of scalping activity. In contrast, concerts that adopt identity verification have fewer than ten reported cases, demonstrating that the system can effectively prevent scalpers.</p>
      <img src="https://github.com/harperchouu/portfolio/blob/main/%E6%98%AF%20(49).png?raw=true" alt="Survey Image" 
      style="max-width:70%; height:auto; display:block; margin:20px auto;">
      <p>Chen emphasized that his team’s ultimate goal is “to make an identity verification and lottery-based system mandatory for all concerts in Taipei, to ensure a fair and transparent ticketing process for fans.” However, scalper Mr. N remains skeptical of the new approaches. He agrees that the two systems can increase the difficulty involved in reselling tickets, but argues that they will place a heavier burden on concert organizers. TixCraft’s Chiu, meanwhile, questioned the effectiveness of lottery-based systems, suggesting they do little to deter scalping and may even increase the risk of rigging. Moreover, if fans who win tickets later cancel them, organizers have to redraw the lottery, a process that requires considerable time, effort, and money. This added complexity will ultimately discourage the adoption of such systems.</p>
     
      <p>Meanwhile, fans have also expressed doubts. Lin pointed out that if a fan fails to secure a ticket during the initial release, their chances of obtaining one later are nearly zero under a lottery system. “Real fans who want to attend the concert are left without any opportunity at all,” she said.</p>
      <p>These challenges highlight the difficulty of designing a ticketing system that deters scalping while also maintaining the rights of concert organizers, entertainment companies, and fans.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <h2>Fans Call for Fair Ticketing<br>
        Lawmakers Propose Third-Party Exchange Platforms
        </h2><br>
      <p>The imbalance in supply and demand has made ticket scalping an inevitable phenomenon. Since  demand for scalped tickets remains high, it is difficult for the government to motivate the public to report scalpers and investigate them accordingly. However, some fans still believe that anti-scalping efforts must continue. One young fan, Tsai, proposed that the government should raise public awareness of the illegality of ticket scalping, while organizers should encourage fans to buy tickets from official websites. At the same time, offering priority ticket access to members and limiting the number of tickets each person can purchase will create a more equitable situation for all fans.</p>
      <p>To ensure fair ticketing, Chen further proposed that the government refer to international practices, such as local governments supporting a third-party ticket exchange platform. He also emphasized that combining identity verification with a lottery-based system makes it harder for scalpers and easier for authorities to track illegal sales across various platforms: “Inflated prices and the use of bots to reap excessive profits are unacceptable to fans in Taiwan...We introduced these new approaches not to guarantee everyone will get a ticket, but to ensure that everyone has an equal opportunity to try.” </p>
      <p>Although buying scalped tickets or seeking better seats through resellers remains common today, most fans still hope for a fairer and more transparent ticketing system. For many, nothing matters more than seeing their idols in person. Closer cooperation between the government and organizers on a new ticketing system could be the next step forward.</p>
