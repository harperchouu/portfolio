    <article><br>
      <p>In mid-November 2024, a group of students from Batumi Shota Rustaveli State University staged a sit-in on campus to express their dissatisfaction with the Oct. 26 election. Their actions inspired students from other universities, as well as residents across Georgia, to follow suit.</p>

      <p>On Nov. 17, people gathered on Ilia Chavchavadze Avenue and outside Ivane Javakhishvili Tbilisi State University to protest the election results, accusing the election of being fraudulent and influenced by Russian interference.</p>

      <p>“The Georgian society is highly pro-European. In the different polls, usually 75-80% of voters come out as pro-Europeans who support the [country’s] European integration and joining the European Union,” said László Róbert Mézes, a protester and local journalist.</p>

      <p>But according to Reuters, the ruling Georgian Dream party won 53% of the vote in the Oct 26 election. Protesters were suspicious of the win given that Georgian Dream had repeatedly hindered Georgia’s path toward EU membership while strengthening ties with countries like China and Russia. “Georgian Dream used to hide its authoritarian tendencies, but now they’re not even pretending anymore,” protester Goga Vachnadze said.</p>
      <p>The pro-Russian party’s victory has had a significant impact on Georgians. In recent months, the party has introduced several controversial pieces of legislation, including anti-LGBTQ+ laws and restrictions on free speech, triggering a nationwide backlash against the party’s policies. Protesters pitched tents in the streets overnight, calling for an investigation into the election, a new election held under international supervision, and the rejection of laws influenced by foreign powers.</p>
      <p>On the evening of Nov.19, police reportedly responded with force, arresting several protesters and journalists. “I think the police completely overreacted. They didn’t just detain us, they beat us,” said Vachnadze, who claimed officers even tried to shoot him with rubber bullets. “The government deployed three large water cannon trucks, and the number of police and riot officers far outnumbered the protesters,” Mézes recalled.</p>
    
      <p>On Nov. 20, around 450 professors and students gathered at Ivane Javakhishvili Tbilisi State University to issue a joint declaration lambasting the university administration for allowing police and security forces onto campus to attack student protesters. The declaration condemned such actions as a violation of the university’s founding principles, including academic freedom, and demanded the resignation of Chancellor Jaba Samushia.</p>
    
      <p>“Universities exist for students, they should never silence student protests,” said Tina (a pseudonym), a Georgian student currently studying at Minerva University.</p>
      <p>Mézes noted that while some reports suggest the university was pressured by Russian authorities, “it is still unacceptable for a university to harm its students.”</p>
    
      <p>Corresponding protests have erupted across Georgia and continue to this day. Mézes believes that whether the protests continue will depend on the attitude of the Georgian people and Western countries. </p> 
      <p>Nonetheless, Tina remained optimistic that their movement would endure. “At least people in Georgia are willing to stand up and fight for their future.”</p>
